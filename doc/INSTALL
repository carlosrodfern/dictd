INSTALLATION
============

0. Since dictd-2.0.0 mk-configure is used as a build system instead of
   autobloat.

   So, install it first!

1. Install libmaa development files

2. dictd project consists of the following subprojects:

    - dict                : Command-line dictionary protocol client
    - dictd               : Dictionary protocol server
    - dictfmt             : Formats a dictionary database for dictd
    - dictzip             : [Un]compress files, allowing random access
    - dictl               : dict(1) wrapper for non-UTF8 terminals
    - dict_lookup         : Dictionary client for X Window System
    - colorit             : Script for colorizing the text input

   Full list of subprojects may be seen by running

        mkcmake help

3. In order to build the whold project, run the following

        mkcmake all

   for building, and

        mkcmake install

   for installation.

4. For building some projects, one may use something like

        mkcmake all-colorit install-colorit

5. Build options are set with the help of environment variables, such as
   PREFIX, BINDIR, SYSCONFDIR, DESTDIR, CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS etc.
   Have a look at mk-configure(7) for details.

    Example:

        export PREFIX=/usr
        export MANDIR=/usr/share/man
        export SYSCONFDIR=/etc
        export CC=clang
        export DESTDIR=/tmp/temp-root
        export COPTS='-O2 -g'
        mkcmake all install

    The default PREFIX is /usr/local.

6.  Download dictionary databases and setup a proper server, you will
    need to configure a dictd.conf file.  Please see the man page
    dictd.8 and the example .conf files included with the source code
    for an explanation of the syntax needed and other important
    details.  By default, dictd will try to find this file as
    '/etc/dictd.conf', however if you start 'dictd' with the
    '-c /your/path/to/mydictd.conf', it will use that
    file as the configuration file instead.

    For our example, with our web1913 database in /opt/public/dict-dbs,
    a MINIMAL dictd.conf file would be:

        database web1913 { data "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.dict.dz"
                          index "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.index" }

7.  If you're installing this software for "intranet" use, you will want to
    setup a 'dict.conf' file which the client software (dict) uses to
    locate servers and such.  The syntax of the dict.conf file is not
    documented anywhere that I can find, however if you have your 'dictd'
    server running on the host named dict.company.com, then you should put
    the following line in your dict.conf file so that users of the 'dict'
    client do not have to specify '-h dict.company.com' each time they
    want to query dictd:

        server dict.example.com

8.  That's it really.  Now pieces everything together, run your dictd and
    point it at your config file, and try running dict!


GENERAL EXTRA INSTALL HELP
==========================

If the above information all isn't very clear, here's a view of good
distributed environment's setup:

    /usr/local/sbin/dictd         # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/bin/dict           # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/bin/dictfmt        # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/etc/dictd.conf     # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/etc/dict.conf      # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/lib/dict-dbs       # Accessible from all hosts on our net

    /usr/local/etc/dictd.conf contains 2 lines:

        database web1913 { data "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.dict.dz"
                          index "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.index" }

    /usr/local/etc/dict.conf contains 1 line:

        server dict

This setup allows ANY host on the network to quickly and easily become
the dictd server.  All you have to do is setup a 'host alias' for the
name 'dict' to point at whatever host you want to be the dictd server
and then start dictd on that host.

NOTE:  I had to install the dictd.conf and dict.conf in that location
       BY HAND.  This is not done automatically for you.
